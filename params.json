{"name":"M2E Connector for the Maven Dependency Plugin","tagline":"","body":"M2E connector for the Maven Dependency Plugin\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\nThis m2e connector for the Maven Dependency Plugin adds a lifecycle mapping for the\r\n[Unpack Mojo](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/unpack-mojo.html).  It will be executed during\r\nfull and incremental builds, and configured outputDirectory(s) will then be refreshed.\r\n\r\n## FAQ ##\r\n\r\n### How do I use it? ###\r\n\r\nFirst off, note that this is currently Beta code.  It has been minimally tested, and all the usual early adopter\r\nwarnings apply.  That said if you're willing to help test the connector all you have to do is:\r\n\r\n1. Add the following [update site](http://help.eclipse.org/juno/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-127.htm?cp=0_3_15_5):\r\nhttp://ianbrandt.github.com/m2e-maven-dependency-plugin/snapshots/\r\n1. Install it into Eclipse like any other [new feature](http://help.eclipse.org/juno/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-124.htm?cp=0_3_15_1).\r\n1. Remove any [lifecycle mapping metadata](http://wiki.eclipse.org/M2E_plugin_execution_not_covered#ignore_plugin_goal) you might have had in your POMs for the dependency:unpack goal.\r\n\r\nThat's it!  The connector will run on full and incremental builds, leaving it to the Maven Dependency Plugin's [overwrite rules](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/usage.html#aOverwrite_Rules) to unpack the artifacts when appropriate.\r\n\r\n_A word of warning_: be mindful of your overwrite rules.  Forcing an unpack for every IDE build could be harmful to performance.\r\n\r\n### How can I help the project? ###\r\n\r\nThanks for asking...\r\n\r\n* If you're a dependency:unpack user:\r\n\t* Test this out.  [File an issue](https://github.com/ianbrandt/m2e-maven-dependency-plugin/issues) if it doesn't\r\n\twork for you.  File an issue if you think it should do something more, or something different.\r\n* If you're a user of any other Maven Dependency Plugin goal:\r\n\t* File an issue to request mappings for additional goals.  Support for copy, copy-dependencies, and\r\n\tunpack-dependencies is currently planned to be similar to that of unpack.  Perhaps you have different needs for\r\n\tthose goals?  Be as specific as possible in describing the behavior you would expect.  If you think the behavior\r\n\tmight warrant configuration, either via files or a UI, share your vision for this as well.\r\n* If you're a Tycho expert:\r\n\t* Skim the POMs.  File an issue or submit a pull request if there is something that could be done better.\r\n* If you're an Eclipse Plugin or m2e expert:\r\n\t* Skim the source and suggest improvements via issues or pull requests.\r\n\t* Contribute new test cases.\r\n* If you're a representative of the Eclipse Foundation or Apache Software Foundation or similar:\r\n\t* I'd be happy to consider donating this plugin&mdash;do get in touch.\r\n\r\n## Thanks ##\r\n\r\nMany thanks to [Fred Bricon](https://community.jboss.org/people/fbricon \"Fred Bricon at JBoss\") for his help on IRC;\r\nhis work on [m2e](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/) and [m2e-wtp](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e-wtp/); and his\r\n[m2e-wro4j connector](https://github.com/jbosstools/m2e-wro4j), which I cribbed from heavily to create this plugin.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
